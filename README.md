## Authors
Thanks for the author of [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com), [Joey de Vries](https://joeydevries.com).
He made this OpenGL extensive tutorials which are very helpful.

The author completed this 2D game in Windows while this program run in macOS. For his tutorials he used GLFW liarary to create OpenGL context and application window. In this project, I used NSOpenGLView to create OpenGL context and render my game. Meanwhile, I used AVAudioPlayer to play audio instead of irrKlang. This project also used freetype library to render text as same as the origin.
